# HAVING

`HAVING` is a clause in SQL that allows you to filter result sets in a `GROUP BY` clause. It is used to mention conditions on the groups being selected. In other words, `HAVING` is mainly used with the `GROUP BY` clause to filter the results that a `GROUP BY` returns. 

Itâ€™s similar to a `WHERE` clause, but operates on the results of a grouping. The `WHERE` clause places conditions on the selected columns, whereas the `HAVING` clause places conditions on groups created by the `GROUP BY` clause.
